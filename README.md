Results

Key Insights:

1.Overall Performance Trends:
	•	The USA has consistently dominated the Olympics, achieving a record-breaking 5637 medals, far ahead of other countries.
	•	The former Soviet Union (URS) ranks second with 2503 medals, followed by Germany (2165) and Great Britain (2068).
2.Medal Trends Over Time:
	•	Medal tallies for the USA show sharp peaks, especially post-1980, indicating consistent dominance across decades.
	•	China’s rise in the late 20th century and early 21st century showcases their growing impact on the Olympics.
	•	Russia and Great Britain maintain consistent performance, though the early and mid-20th century saw variations.
3.Visualization Highlights:
	•	The line graph illustrates the dynamic shifts in medal-winning trends between top-performing nations over the years.
	•	Peaks in certain years correlate with global events such as World Wars and the Cold War, impacting Olympic participation and outcomes.
4.Historical Influence:
	•	Political and economic factors like the dissolution of the Soviet Union and China’s increased participation in international sports contributed to medal tally trends.
