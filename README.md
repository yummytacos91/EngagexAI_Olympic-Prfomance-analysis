Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Olympic performance data using AI and data analytics.
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and insights to better
understand trends in athletic achievements.


•Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data.
•Exploratory Analysis: Statistical summaries and visualizations.
•Insights: Key trends in Olympic performance.
•Outputs: Final visualizations and processed data.

Run the code:
  	•Scripts: run the file AI_PROJECT.ipynb
   	•Outputs: Review results in the output code & output.png


Technologies Used

•Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
•GitHub for version control

Results

Key Insights:

1.Overall Performance Trends:
	•The USA has consistently dominated the Olympics, achieving a record-breaking 5637 medals, far ahead of other countries.
	•The former Soviet Union (URS) ranks second with 2503 medals, followed by Germany (2165) and Great Britain (2068).
2.Medal Trends Over Time:
	•Medal tallies for the USA show sharp peaks, especially post-1980, indicating consistent dominance across decades.
	•China’s rise in the late 20th century and early 21st century showcases their growing impact on the Olympics.
	•Russia and Great Britain maintain consistent performance, though the early and mid-20th century saw variations.
3.Visualization Highlights:
	•The line graph illustrates the dynamic shifts in medal-winning trends between top-performing nations over the years.
	•Peaks in certain years correlate with global events such as World Wars and the Cold War, impacting Olympic participation and outcomes.
4.Historical Influence:
	•Political and economic factors like the dissolution of the Soviet Union and China’s increased participation in international sports contributed to medal tally trends.

•Visualizations: Check the outputs.png file for chart.
Challenges Faced:
1.Data Quality and Preprocessing:
	•Handling missing and inconsistent data entries, requiring additional preprocessing to ensure accuracy.
	•Converting and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis.
	2.Complexity of Analysis:
	•Identifying meaningful trends amidst a vast dataset with numerous variables.
	•Selecting appropriate statistical and visualization techniques to ensure clarity.
	3.Time Constraints:
	•Balancing between multiple tasks, including data cleaning, coding, visualization, and preparing insights, within a limited timeframe.
	4.Tool Limitations:
	•Dealing with performance issues when analyzing large datasets on limited computational resources.
	5.Collaboration and Organization:
	•Managing code structure, folder organization, and ensuring all outputs were updated and stored systematically in the repository.
